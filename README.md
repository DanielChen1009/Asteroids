# Asteroids

This is an Asteroids game I programmed using Java and transpiled to JavaScript using PlayN. It features seamless wrapping, procedurally generated objects/effects, and realistic collision physics. For a demo, please visit [my website](https://daniel-chen.net/index.php/asteroids-game).

To accelerate the triangle (ship) forward, press the up arrow key. To turn the ship, press the left or right buttons. To fire a bullet, press spacebar. Try to blow up as many asteroids as you can without getting hit.

There are four different kinds of powerups you can pickup. They appear as wandering squares in the game. Discover what they do by playing the game!

On mobile, you can fire by quickly tapping anywhere in the world and move by dragging your finger around. It might take some getting used to, so a real keyboard is recommended.
